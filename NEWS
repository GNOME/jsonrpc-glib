Version 3.34.0
==============

 • No changes since 3.33.3.

==============
Version 3.33.3
==============

Changes in this release:

 • Custom marshallers are now provided for all signals to improve the
   stack-unwinding capability from kernel tooling such as Linux `perf`.
 • Various build system improvements.

==============
Version 3.32.0
==============

No changes in this release

===============
Version 3.31.91
===============

Changes in this release:

 • Improve cross-compilation support.

==============
Version 3.30.1
==============

Changes in this release:

 • When --buildtype=release is used, assertion checks are disabled
   and -Bsymbolic is used.

==============
Version 3.30.0
==============

No changes in this release since our beta 3.29.91.

===============
Version 3.29.91
===============

Changes in this release:

 • Fix of double-free in generated vala bindings
 • Floating reference fixes for some gvariants
 • Use g_bytes_new_take() to simplify memory tracking
 • Some variants are now unwrapped to simplify usage by consumers.
 • Unit tests now disable SIGPIPE
 • test-client was removed as it was dead code

==============
Version 3.29.4
==============

Changes in this release:

 • More lenient testing for transient errors
 • Increased compiler warnings when building on GCC
 • Vala vapi generation improvements

==============
Version 3.29.3
==============

Changes in this release:

 • Various introspection fixes
 • Add JsonrpcServer::client-closed
 • Emit JsonrpcClient::failed upon panic
 • Helpers for strv message building and parsing
 • Output stream now tracks busy status
 • Support for boxing/unboxing a{sv} variants
 • Version ABI macros were added
 • A new variant for calling a remote method and get message id
 • Fixes for an invalid type propagation

==============
Version 3.28.0
==============

There are no changes since 3.27.91.

===============
Version 3.27.91
===============

Changes in this release:

 • Add JsonrpcServer::client-accepted signal.
 • Improvements to dispatching of errors when panic'ing the connection.
 • Message parsing is more liberal in what it accepts as input.
 • Default ABI visibility was set to hidden, making our ABI macros useful.

===============
Version 3.27.90
===============

Changes in this release:

 • More documentation and GObject Introspection additions.
 • Fixes for documentation and taking of floating references from
   GVariant params.
 • The soname has been bumped since we altered the correctness of
   GVariant params. C-based programs mostly just need to be recompiled.
   Other bindings-based consumers should have their bindings regenerated
   if necessary.
 • When panic'ing a connection (such as from a broken pipe) we now
   defer error propagation back to the main loop to avoid some
   re-entrancy complexity for applications.

Distributors:

 In this cycle we had to break our GObject Introspection documentation
 that was correct for the transfer ownership of GVariant. Additionally, we
 fixed the miss-named library libjsonrpc_glib-1.0 to libjsonrpc-glib-1.0.
 Since we bumped our soname, it is a good time to fix this in your
 packaging.

==============
Version 3.27.4
==============

Changes in this release:

 • The JSONRPC_MESSAGE_NEW_ARRAY() macro was added to allow for creating
   GVariant messages that are an array.
 • A number of conformance tests were added.
 • JsonrpcClient allows for detailed signals (G_SIGNAL_DETAILED) for
   notification and handle-call signals.
 • JsonrpcServer gained new functionality to enumerate the number of
   connected clients.
 • JsonrpcClient tries to hold on to an additional reference when
   panic is called.
 • Message parsing can now support NULL strings using maybe types when
   encoding and decoding messages.

==============
Version 3.27.1
==============

Changes in this release:

 • jsonrpc-glib now uses versioning macros similar to GLib or Gtk instead
   of a custom linker script for ABI exports.

==============
Version 3.26.0
==============

Changes in this release:

 • Run test suite as part of build tooling

===============
Version 3.25.92
===============

Changes in this release:

 • Check for version-script support from linker
 • Fix impossible comparison in JsonrpcInputStream

==============
Version 3.25.3
==============

This new release of jsonrpc-glib contains a few fixes and additions.

 • Support for gtk-doc based documentation has been added. Use
   -Denable_gtk_doc=true to enable it when configuring Meson.
 • JsonrpcServer now supports a convenience API for handling incoming
   methods via jsonrpc_server_add_handler() and
   jsonrpc_server_remove_handler().
 • Support has been added to allow jsonrpc-glib to be used as a Meson
   subproject.
 • jsonrpc-version.h now generates the proper values for checking
   compile time version information.
 • Various build options were canonicalized to use _ instead of -
   as a word separator.

==============
Version 3.25.2
==============

This is the first release of jsonrpc-glib.

This is an early project, but things seem to be working well so it's time for a
release.  You can use jsonrpc-glib to create both JSON RPC clients and servers.
Additionally, it supports connection upgrades to GVariant when both sides
support it instead of JSON to reduce parser overhead and lesson the chances of
memory fragmentation.

Things to note

 • Initial release of jsonrpc-glib.
 • We'll follow the GNOME release cycle.
 • You JsonrpcClient and JsonrpcServer should handle most of what you need
 • See jsonrpc-message.h for a convenient va_args based C API.

Thanks!
